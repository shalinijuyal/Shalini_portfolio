            It is crucial to maintain honesty during interviews, as validation checks are conducted to verify claims made by candidates. Any false information can backfire and harm credibility.
            Apart from technical expertise, strong communication, adaptability, and interpersonal skills play a significant role in career growth and professional success.

<div class="lecture">
    <h2>Lecture 7: Situation-Based Questions</h2>
    <p>
        In this lecture, we discussed how to effectively answer situation-based questions.<br>
        We emphasized the importance of understanding the question thoroughly, analyzing the situation carefully, and providing a clear, concise, and objective answer.<br>
        By minimizing emotional bias and practical distractions, we can deliver more logical and impactful responses.
    </p>

    <h3>Situation We Worked On:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>You are in a position to make critical choices that could save lives.</li>
        <li>In a remote village of around 1,000 people, there is a coal mine located on the bank of a river.</li>
        <li>The villagers depend heavily on this coal mine for their livelihood.</li>
        <li>A 75-year-old scientist, suffering from a brain tumor, was working in the mine on a revolutionary technology that could generate energy for over 100 years. Due to his unusual ideas, people often called him a "mad scientist."</li>
        <li>A young woman suffering from asthma was at the mine conducting a survey.</li>
        <li>During a routine blast in the mine, the explosion accidentally broke the riverbank wall, causing water to flood the mine.</li>
        <li>The workers panicked and evacuated immediately.</li>
        <li>However, the scientist, the young woman, the mine owner, and a little boy got trapped inside.</li>
        <li>There is a lift that can rescue people one at a time.</li>
        <li>The mine will be completely flooded within 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Each lift trip (up or down) takes 2 minutes.</li>
        <li><b>You must decide who to save.</b></li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        We explored various approaches to this dilemma and discussed how to make the best possible decision in such challenging circumstances.
